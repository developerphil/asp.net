OWASP risk factors

--Injection

Parameters in the querystring e.g. {product=1 or 1=1}, {product=(Select name from sysobjects where id=(select top 1 id from (select top 3 id from sysobjects where xtype=char(85) order by id asc)))}

Input can be from cookies, request header, form post, query string, external services, own database data imports.

Principle of least privilege e.g. no access to write etc, better only access to read tables even better only runs stored procedures.

Whitelist validation - data entering the system
Approaches - type conversion e.g. integer, date
			 Regular expressions - for strings e.g email addresses, phone numbers
			 List of known good values

Use an ORM e.g. entity framework, nhibernate
			 
Stored Procedure a vulnerable e.g. dynamic sql in a stored procedure more secure use sp_executesql to parametrisation of sql 
			 
Havijj third party to tool to test your site for sql injection

--Cross site Scripting XXS

https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc512662.aspx

Reflective XSS
Reflection of query e.g. search term - to the page putting code on to the page e.g. script tag. Real example samy myspace
Encode - HtmlEncoding different encode for different lanaguages e.g. javascript, css
Use supported encoding e.g. AntiXssEncoder
Password - <script> ok mvc - decorate [AllowHtml] on property on model

Persistence XSS

Database records e.g. add to a list and then get all

--Broken Authenication and Session Management

Session Id not in url because email url or posting url on facebook for example
Be careful of cookies e.g. http only, secure https
Use tried and tested frameworks e.g. forms authentication options sliding authentication or fixed 
Session timeout not to long

--Insecure direct object reference

e.g. customerid=1 in query string retrieve records
use indirect reference maps abstraction (example indirectreference\IndirectRefMap.cs e.g. use id=id.GetIndirectReference())
obfuscation via random surrogate keys e.g. use GUID for id - Guid for db are expensive
check user is allowed to see data
